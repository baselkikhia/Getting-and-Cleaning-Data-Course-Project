3- Merge the training and test datasets in mergedata
4- Change the name of the columns in mergedata to the features' names
5- Find the names of the features that contain mean or std and save then in targetnames
6- Create a new table from mergedata with the appropriate values (only features with mean or std), and save it in meanStd
7- Merge train and test labels, and save it in mergelabels
8- Change the names of the labels in mergelabels based on the names presented in activity_labels 
9- Create a file with tidy data, and save it in tidy_data
10- Save the data in .txt file called tidy_data.txt
11- Create an independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and save it in a txt file called Results_mean.txt
